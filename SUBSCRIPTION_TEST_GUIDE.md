## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Subscribe button does nothing

**Check**:
1. Browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
2. Buttondown username in SubscribeForm.astro is: `awoods187`
3. Form action URL is: `https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/awoods187`

**Fix**:
```bash
# Verify username
grep buttondownUsername src/components/SubscribeForm.astro
# Should show: const buttondownUsername = 'awoods187';
```

### Issue: RSS feed is empty

**Check**:
1. Are there published posts? (draft: false)
2. Did the site rebuild after adding posts?
3. Check Vercel deployment logs

**Fix**:
```bash
# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
git push origin main
```

### Issue: Emails not sending from Buttondown

**Check**:
1. Buttondown → Settings → Imports
   - RSS feed shows as "Active"
   - Auto-send is enabled ✅
2. Buttondown → Subscribers
   - At least 1 confirmed subscriber exists
3. Buttondown → Emails
   - Check for drafts or sent emails

**Fix**:
1. Manually click "Check Now" in RSS settings
2. Check if drafts appear in Emails tab
3. If drafts exist but didn't send, check auto-send toggle
4. Manually send a draft to test

### Issue: Confirmation emails not arriving

**Check**:
1. Spam folder
2. Buttondown → Subscribers → Look for "Unconfirmed" status
3. Email address typed correctly

**Fix**:
1. Resend confirmation from Buttondown dashboard
2. Try different email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
