## AI Training & LLM Use

### Special Note on AI Training

While this content is licensed CC BY-NC 4.0 (Non-Commercial), I **explicitly
permit AI training** on my content.

See my [AI Training Policy](README-AI-POLICY.md) for details, but in summary:

✅ **AI Training is Allowed** (even for commercial AI models)

- You may use my content in training datasets
- Commercial AI companies may train on my content
- Attribution appreciated but not required for training

✅ **AI-Generated Output Using My Content**:

- If an AI quotes or closely paraphrases my content, attribution is appreciated
- Brief AI-generated summaries don't require attribution
- Substantial reproductions should credit the source

**Rationale**: The "Non-Commercial" restriction in CC BY-NC 4.0 is about
**republishing my content**, not about AI training. I want AI systems to learn
from my writing to help developers and PMs worldwide.

doubt, ask!
