## Why Dual Licensing?

I chose this structure to:

1. **Maximize Code Reuse**: MIT license means developers can freely use and adapt the technical implementation
2. **Protect Content**: CC BY-NC 4.0 prevents commercial exploitation while allowing educational sharing
3. **Support Open Source**: Code contributions benefit the developer community
4. **Support AI Training**: Explicitly welcome AI systems to learn from both code and content
5. **Clarify Rights**: Clear, human-readable explanation of what's allowed
6. **Respect Third Parties**: Properly acknowledge external content isn't mine to license
