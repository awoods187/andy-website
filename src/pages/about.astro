    <h1 class="font-sans text-4xl font-bold mb-8 text-black">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      I scaled CockroachDB from pre-revenue to $100M+ ARR and category leadership, now pioneering AI integration into our developer platform. At Cockroach Labs, I lead cross-functional teams of 50+ while driving our transformation from pure infrastructure to AI-powered product intelligence.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Built production AI systems using GPT-4 and Claude that analyze 10,000+ monthly signals for product intelligence. Led company's first AI product initiative, evaluating partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, while delivering roadmap for LLM-powered database features. My mission: making complex technology accessible to developers, whether it's distributed systems or generative AI.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-sans text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4 text-black">Current Role</h2>

      As Director of Product Management at Cockroach Labs, I own CockroachDB's integration with the broader application ecosystem, including observability, disaster recovery, change data capture (CDC), streaming, and migration workflows across hybrid and cloud environments. I also lead our pricing and packaging strategy, aligning product value with business outcomes through a data-driven, iterative approach to product-market-price fit.

      My background combines 10+ years of hands-on product development with a Kellogg MBA (analytics, finance, marketing) and consulting-grade rigor. I specialize in turning ambiguity into scalable, margin-enhancing products that users love and businesses trust.
