    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
      I helped scale CockroachDB from pre-revenue to $100M+ ARR and category leadership. As Director of Product for Application and Database Ecosystem, I lead cross-functional teams of 50+ people driving our evolution into the AI-powered application ecosystem. My teams are building AI-powered customer support and automated database migrations, while I've personally built intelligent tools for product management and marketing operations. I oversee product strategy, engineering execution, and go-to-market initiatives across our developer platform and ecosystem.

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Built production AI systems using GPT-4 and Claude that analyze 10,000+ monthly signals for product intelligence. Led company's first AI product initiative, evaluating partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, while delivering roadmap for LLM-powered database features. My mission: making complex technology accessible to developers, whether it's distributed systems or generative AI.
