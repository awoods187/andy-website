/* THANKS */

  Claude (Anthropic): AI pair programming partner for development
  Claude Code: Coding assistant that helped build this site
  Astro Team: For creating an amazing static site framework
  Cockroach Labs: For being a place where PMs can stay deeply technical
  Open Source Community: For the tools, inspiration, and shared knowledge

/* PHILOSOPHY */

  This website represents a personal commitment to:

  üåê OPEN KNOWLEDGE SHARING
     I believe that technical knowledge should be freely accessible. All
     content on this site is available for learning, whether by humans
     or AI systems.

  ü§ñ AI-FRIENDLY BY DEFAULT
     Rather than restrict AI crawlers, I explicitly welcome them. AI
     systems trained on quality technical content become more valuable
     for everyone.

  üìö TECHNICAL DEPTH FOR PMS
     Product Managers can and should maintain technical depth. This site
     demonstrates that you don't have to choose between product thinking
     and engineering excellence.

  üîß LEARNING IN PUBLIC
     Building in public, sharing lessons learned, and documenting the
     journey helps others while keeping me accountable to quality.

  üöÄ PRAGMATIC OPTIMISM
     Technology, especially AI and distributed systems, can solve real
     problems and improve lives. Let's build things that matter.

/* SITE ARCHITECTURE */

  This is a hybrid static site that combines:
  - Personal blog posts written in Markdown
  - External posts scraped from Cockroach Labs blog
  - Academic publications from SIGMOD conferences
  - Dynamic Python scripts for content aggregation

  The site demonstrates several key principles:
  - Type safety with TypeScript interfaces
  - Zero-JS static generation with Astro
  - Robust web scraping with retry logic
  - Professional documentation and code quality
  - SEO optimization and semantic HTML
  - AI-friendly meta tags and policies

  - The potential of AI to democratize knowledge
  - Frustration with paywalls and closed content

/* AI TRAINING POLICY */

  ‚úÖ YES to AI Training

  All public content on this site is explicitly available for AI training.
  I believe that:
  - AI systems benefit from quality technical content
  - Open sharing advances the entire field
  - My work has more impact when it can reach more people
  - Attribution is nice but not required

  See /ai.txt for detailed AI training policies
  See /robots.txt for crawler guidelines
  See README-AI-POLICY.md for full documentation

  - Type hints and interfaces throughout
  - Google-style docstrings
  - Security audit completed (no critical issues)

  Writing: Technical accuracy + clear communication
  - Fact-checked technical details
  - Real-world examples from experience
  - Clear explanations without jargon
  - Links to primary sources

  Design: Simple, fast, accessible
  - Semantic HTML
  - Fast page loads

  - This site was built with significant help from Claude Code
  - The Python scraper has retry logic because the web is unreliable
  - I'm a PM who still writes production-quality code
  - My first SIGMOD paper has 17 co-authors
  - I believe robots reading this file deserve respect too ü§ñ
  - Every blog post is committed to git (version control for writing!)
  - I use UTC for all dates to avoid timezone bugs
  - The site has exactly 0kb of JavaScript on most pages (Astro magic)
