# Building Resilient Distributed Systems

Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to build correctly. After helping scale CockroachDB to handle mission-critical workloads at enterprises worldwide, I've learned a few hard-won lessons...

## Why These License Fields?

### Frontmatter License Metadata

The frontmatter fields (`license`, `copyright`, `attribution`) serve multiple purposes:

1. **Machine-Readable**: Can be parsed by scripts, AI crawlers, and content management systems
2. **Discoverable**: Shows up in metadata, making licensing clear to automated systems
3. **Type-Safe**: Can be validated by Astro's content collection schema (Zod)
4. **Programmatic**: Can be displayed automatically in post templates

### Footer License Notice

The footer serves human readers:

1. **Human-Readable**: Clear, plain-language explanation of rights
2. **Visible**: Appears at the end of every post
3. **Actionable**: Includes links to license and contact info
4. **Consistent**: Same format across all posts

---

## Updating Existing Blog Posts

To add licensing to existing posts:

1. **Add frontmatter fields** (license, copyright, attribution)
2. **Add footer** (license notice at bottom)
3. **Update year** in copyright to post's original publication year
4. **Verify** by building the site and checking the output

---

## Astro Content Collection Schema

To enforce these license fields, update your `src/content/config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const blog = defineCollection({
  type: 'content',
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    date: z.date(),
    excerpt: z.string(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
    image: z.string().optional(),
    draft: z.boolean().optional(),

    // License fields (optional but recommended)
    license: z.string().optional().default('CC BY-NC 4.0'),
    copyright: z.string().optional(),
    attribution: z.string().optional(),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog };
```

---

## Displaying License in Post Template

To automatically display license information from frontmatter:

```astro
---
// In src/pages/blog/[slug].astro
const { Content, data } = await entry.render();
const { title, date, license, copyright, attribution } = data;
---

<article>
  <h1>{title}</h1>
  <time>{date}</time>

  <Content />

  {license && (
    <footer class="license-notice">
      <h2>License</h2>
      <p>
        This post is licensed under
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">{license}</a>.
        {copyright && <span>{copyright}</span>}
      </p>
      {attribution && <p><em>{attribution}</em></p>}
      <p>
        For commercial republishing, please contact me via
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewscottwoods/">LinkedIn</a>.
      </p>
    </footer>
  )}
</article>
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to add this to every post?

**A**: Yes, for clarity. While the repository LICENSE-CONTENT.md covers all content, individual posts should have explicit licensing for:
- Clarity for readers
- Machine-readable metadata
- Syndication/republishing clarity
- SEO and discoverability

### Q: What year should I use in copyright?

**A**: Use the year the post was **originally published**, not the current year. For example:
- Post published in 2024: `© 2024 Andy Woods`
- Post published in 2025: `© 2025 Andy Woods`

### Q: Can I use a different license for some posts?

**A**: Yes, but be explicit. If you want to use a different license (e.g., MIT for a code-heavy tutorial), clearly state it in both frontmatter and footer.

### Q: What about posts written for other companies?

**A**: If you wrote a post for Cockroach Labs or another company:
- That post is **© Company Name**
- Do NOT add CC BY-NC 4.0 license to their posts
- Link to the original source and note their copyright
